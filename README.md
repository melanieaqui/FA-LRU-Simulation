Detailed Analysis of the Test Cases.

a.) Sequential sequence: up to 2n cache block. Repeat the sequence four times. Example: 0,1,2,3,...,2n-1 {4x}

Input:

Output:

Explanation: 

b.) Random sequence: containing 4n blocks.
Input:

Output:

Explanation: 

c.) Mid-repeat blocks: Start at block 0, repeat the sequence in the middle two times up to n-1 blocks, after
which continue up to 2n. Then, repeat the sequence four times. Example: if n=8, sequence=0, 1,2,3,4,5,6,
1,2,3,4,5,6, 7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 {4x}
